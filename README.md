## Technologies Used

*   HTML5
*   CSS3 (Sass with Autoprefixer and CSSNano)
*   JavaScript (ES6+ with Babel and Uglify)
*   Gulp (for build automation, including Sass compilation, JS minification, and BrowserSync)
*   NPM (for package management)

## Features

*   Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices (mobile and desktop).
*   Interactive elements with hover states.
*   Smooth navigation.
*   Modern development workflow with Gulp for efficient asset compilation and live reloading.

## How to Run Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/digitalbank-landing-page.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd digitalbank-landing-page
    ```
3.  Install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  Run the Gulp default task to build the project and start the development server:
    ```bash
    npx gulp
    ```
    This will compile your Sass, minify your JavaScript, process HTML kits, and start a `browser-sync` server, which typically opens the project in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
